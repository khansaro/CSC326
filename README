Ths difference between the Lab2 and Lab3 results is that in Lab2, the number of concurrent connections could go upto 15 while now it can only go upto 14. This difference in performance is due to the addition of the database retrieval in Lab3(persistant storage) which takes more time than it took in Lab2 where it wasn't required to access a database.
